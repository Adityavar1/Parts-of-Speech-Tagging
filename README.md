# Parts-of-Speech-Tagging
Built a model using NLTKâ€™s Brown Corpus dataset to identify parts of speech from universal tagset of words in sentence.Individually developed a Hidden Markov Model, incorporating Laplace smoothing from the ground up. Obtained an accuracy of 0.94 and a precision of 0.84 with 5-fold cross validation, reflecting robust model performance.
